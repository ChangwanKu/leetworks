## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(grid)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(gridExtra)

library(pander)

standard <- read.csv('./rawdatas/entrance_standard.csv')

stan1 <- standard %>% filter(schoolindex == 1 & year == 2018) %>% select(level,leet,gpa,lang,doc,essay,interview,sum) %>% replace(.,is.na(.),0)

pandoc.table(stan1, style = 'grid', split.tables = Inf, split.cells = 50,
             keep.line.breaks = TRUE, emphasize.rownames = FALSE,
             big.mark = ",")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
